# Ames Housing

This repository is a case study of applying various machine learning models
    to the problem of predicting house prices.

The dataset is publicly available
    and can be downloaded, for example, at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The case study is based on this [research paper](static/paper.pdf).

A video presentation of the case study is available on [YouTube <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_yt.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSeGseoJsNA).

### Objective

The **main goal** is to **show** students
    how **Python** can be used to solve a typical **data science** task.


### Prerequisites

To be suitable for *beginners*, there are *no* formal prerequisites.
It is only expected that the student has:
- a *solid* understanding of the **English** language and
- knowledge of **basic mathematics** from high school.

Some background knowledge in Python is still helpful.
To learn about Python and programming in detail,
    this [introductory course <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_gh.png">](https://github.com/webartifex/intro-to-python) is recommended.


### Getting started & Installation

To follow this workshop, an installation of **Python 3.8** or higher is expected.

A popular and beginner friendly way is
    to install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    that not only ships Python itself
    but also comes pre-packaged with a lot of third-party libraries
    including [Python's scientific stack](https://scipy.org/about.html).

Detailed instructions can be found [here <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_gh.png">](https://github.com/webartifex/intro-to-python#installation).


## Contributing

Feedback **is highly encouraged** and will be incorporated.
Open an issue in the [issues tracker <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_gh.png">](https://github.com/webartifex/ames-housing/issues)
    or initiate a [pull request <img height="12" style="display: inline-block" src="static/link/to_gh.png">](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)
    if you are familiar with the concept.
Simple issues that *anyone* can **help fix** are, for example,
    **spelling mistakes** or **broken links**.
If you feel that some topic is missing entirely, you may also mention that.
The materials here are considered a **permanent work-in-progress**.
